# code-refactoring-01

## The goal of this project was to refactor an existing webpage to meet accessibility standards, and to increase search engine optimization.

In this project, I edited the source code using more semantic HTML, to improve the flow and accessibility of the page. The CSS stylesheet was adjusted to match the selectors that were changed in the HTML file.

Repetitive selectors were consolidated in the CSS file.

Alt attributes were added to all images, so that a description is available to a screen reader for any pictures or symbols.

A broken link was fixed and a descriptive title added to the page.

Comments were added into the HTML and CSS sheets for clarity and ease of future maintenance.

## What I learned

By working through the steps of refactoring this webpage, I learned the importance of writing clear, streamlined code. It is easier to organize your work initailly than it is to go back over messy code and try to make sense of it while trying to edit.

I also learned some of the ways we can format web pages to make them more accessible to everyone who uses the internet. For example, semantic HTML puts the page into better context and structure when read by a screen reader than non-semantic tags.

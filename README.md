# code-refactoring-01

## The goal of this project was to refactor an existing webpage to meet accessibility standards, and to increase search engine optimization.

I edited the source code, using more semantic HTML to improve the flow and accessibility of the page. The CSS stylesheet was adjusted to match the selectors that were changed in the HTML file, and comments were added for clarity.

Repetative selectors were consolidated in the CSS file.

I added a descriptive title for the webpage.

Alt attributes were added to all images, so that a description is available to a screen reader for any pictures or symbols.
